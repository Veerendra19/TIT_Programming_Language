VAR long_text = SUMMARIZE("Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. It encompasses a broad range of environmental changes that have significant and lasting impacts on the planetâ€™s ecosystems and human societies. Over the past century, the Earth's average surface temperature has risen substantially, largely due to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect.
The primary sources of these emissions are human activities including the burning of fossil fuels for energy, industrial processes, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture. As a consequence of rising temperatures, glaciers and ice caps are melting at unprecedented rates, contributing to rising sea levels and threatening coastal communities worldwide. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns have resulted in more frequent and intense droughts and floods, disrupting water supplies and agricultural productivity.
Biodiversity is also at risk, as many species struggle to adapt to rapidly changing habitats. Coral reefs, which support a large portion of marine life, are bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures and acidification. Climate change also has significant socioeconomic impacts, exacerbating inequalities, displacing populations, and creating new challenges for public health.
Addressing climate change requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable and cleaner energy sources, protecting forests and natural habitats, and investing in climate resilience and adaptation strategies. International cooperation, policy changes, and innovations in technology all play critical roles in mitigating the effects and safeguarding the planet for future generations.")
